                    <b> Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru
                    </b>(14 November 1889 â€“ 27 May 1964) was an Indian anti-colonial nationalist, secular
                    humanist, social democrat and author who was a central figure in India during the middle of the
                    20th century. Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and
                    1940s. Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's prime minister for 16 years.
                    Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s,
                    powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India
                    clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, his books written in prison, such as
                    Letters from a Father to His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of India
                    (1946), have been read around the world. During his lifetime, the honorific Pandit was commonly
                    applied before his name in India.
